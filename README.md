# 🎯 Real-Time Object Detection with YOLOv5 and Webcam

This project implements **real-time object detection** using [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) on a webcam feed, powered by a pretrained model trained on the **COCO dataset**.

- 🧠 YOLOv5s model (pretrained on COCO dataset)
- 📦 Detects 80 common objects (person, car, dog, bottle, etc.)
- 🚀 GPU-accelerated (Jetson, CUDA-supported)
- 🖼️ Displays results with bounding boxes and class labels
- 💾 Option to save cropped detections and detection results
